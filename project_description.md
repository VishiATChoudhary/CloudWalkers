## Project Overview: AI-Powered Development Lifecycle Platform

### **Core Vision & Purpose**

This platform revolutionizes how developers initialize, configure, and manage AI-assisted software projects. It serves as a comprehensive orchestration layer between human intent and AI execution, specifically designed for Claude Code and other agentic development tools. 

The platform solves a critical gap: while AI coding assistants have become powerful, setting up the optimal environment with proper configurations, tool integrations, and governance rules remains complex and fragmented. This tool transforms that chaos into a streamlined, intelligent workflow.

### **The User Journey: Three Interconnected Stages**

    - Compatibility indicators with other selected tools
    - Performance impact meters
  
  **Sub-Agent Designer:**
  - Visual node editor for defining agent relationships
    - Drag-and-drop agent creation
    - Connection lines showing communication paths
    - Role definition cards with capabilities and restrictions
    - Template library for common agent patterns
  
  **Claude.md Editor:**
  - Split-view markdown editor with:
    - Syntax highlighting for special directives
    - Live preview of how Claude will interpret rules
    - Rule validation with suggestions
    - Version comparison tool
  
  **Repository Configuration:**
  - GitHub integration wizard with:
    - Repository name generator with availability check
    - Privacy settings with visual explanations
    - Branch protection rules visualizer
    - CI/CD pipeline configurator

### Functional Features:
- **Dependency Resolver**: Automatically identifies and resolves conflicts between tools
- **Configuration Validator**: Pre-flight checks before repository creation
- **Cost Estimator**: Shows estimated API costs based on selected integrations
- **One-Click Sync**: Push entire configuration to GitHub with single action

## **Stage 3: Project Evolution Monitor**
*"The Living Timeline"*

### Purpose
Revolutionary visualization system that tracks, summarizes, and presents all AI-driven changes over time, making project evolution transparent and manageable.

### UI Design Concept: "The Evolution Tree"

**Visual Design:**
- **Main Interface**: Immersive 3D timeline visualization with multiple view modes
  
- **Color Scheme**: Gradient from past (deep blue #001f3f) to present (bright green #00ff41), creating temporal depth

- **Key UI Elements:**
  
  **Timeline View (Primary):**
  - **Organic Branch Structure**: 
    - Main trunk represents master branch
    - Branches grow organically for features/fixes
    - Glowing nodes for each Claude Code session
    - Particle effects showing code changes flowing through branches
    - Node size indicates change magnitude
  
  **Change Cards (On Hover):**
  - Floating cards appearing on node selection showing:
    - AI agent that made changes
    - Natural language summary of modifications
    - Files affected with diff statistics
    - Performance impact indicators
    - Code quality metrics delta
    - Before/after code snippets with syntax highlighting
  
  **Analytics Dashboard (Top Bar):**
  - **Productivity Metrics**: Lines of code generated/modified over time
    - Agent efficiency scores
    - Bug introduction/resolution rates
    - Technical debt accumulation graph
  
  **Filter Controls (Side Panel):**
  - Time range selector with zoom controls
  - Agent filter (show changes by specific agents)
  - File type filters
  - Change magnitude threshold slider
  - Search through change descriptions
