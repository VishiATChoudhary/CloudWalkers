**Excited to host this exclusive event with Daniel Dippold (EWOR) and Oliver Schoppe (UVC Partners) at Tacto Event Space!**

This is a unique opportunity for founders ready to go all-in. Don't miss it.

**I'm looking for founders who:**
• Are tackling high-impact problems
• Are laser-focused on building NOW
• Need funding to accelerate their venture

**Your pitch doesn't need to be perfect** – that's exactly why we're doing this. Come as you are, but bring your A-game. High effort is non-negotiable. You have 3 minutes sharp to show us what you're building and why it matters.

This is your chance to get real feedback, make meaningful connections, and potentially secure the funding you need.

**Apply now if you're ready to build something extraordinary.**

See you on stage.
